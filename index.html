                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>Once known as the Old Wolf, Guildenstern made a fortune and carved out a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. Today, an older and wiser Guildenstern serves as a "fixer" - a man who connects adventurers with clients in need of mercenaries. 
                    
                    The years have not worn him down, and though he has grown soft in the flesh, he remains deceptively strong, vigorous, and clear of mind. 
                    
                    Guildenstern has survived the passing of centuries by means of magic. Despite his prodigious girth, Guildenstern can move with good speed when he must, and he has not let his adventuring skills wither. 
                    
                    His wife, Asper, passed away several years ago, and his rambling mansion has seen better days. Guildenstern spends his days embroiled in politics and whiles away his nights in drink and debauchery.
